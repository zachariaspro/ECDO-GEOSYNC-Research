# ECDO-GEOSYNC Research

**Exothermic Core-Mantle Decoupling – Dzhanibekov Oscillation theory / Geophysical Synchronization Framework**

Independent geophysical research documenting anomalous changes in Earth's rotational dynamics (1846–2026)

---

## Overview

This repository contains research establishing that Earth's rotational stabilization mechanisms have undergone unprecedented degradation. Three peer-review-ready papers document convergent evidence from polar motion analysis, satellite gravimetry, and geomagnetic field observations.

### Core Findings

| Observable | Baseline | Current (2024–2026) | Change |
|------------|----------|---------------------|--------|
| Chandler wobble amplitude | 204 mas | 3.5 mas | **−98.3%** |
| Annual wobble amplitude | 114 mas | 3.2 mas | **−97.2%** |
| Effective coupling proxy (η) | 100% | 2.0% | **−98.0%** |
| Hook rate toward 75°W | ~15% | >25% | **+67%** |

Both residual wobble signals remain ~100× above IERS measurement precision (0.033 mas), confirming genuine collapse rather than disappearance into noise.

## The Three Papers

### Paper 1: Wobble Extinction
**"Unprecedented Extinction of Earth's Chandler and Annual Wobbles: Evidence for Degraded Core-Mantle Boundary Coupling (1846–2026)"**

Establishes the observational foundation:
- 180 years of IERS polar motion data analyzed
- Both periodic wobble components collapsed to ~2% of baseline
- Annual wobble collapse despite *increased* seasonal forcing (+23%)
- Transfer function failure confirmed — the system converting forcing to response has degraded
- Anti-correlation between components (2010–2015) excludes methodological artifacts

### Paper 2: Directional Forcing
**"Systematic Directional Forcing of Earth's Rotation Pole Toward 75°W: Convergent Evidence from Polar Motion Cusps, Satellite Gravimetry and Geomagnetic Field Correlation (1973–2026)"**

Establishes the directional signature:
- Theoretical prediction from LLSVP physics: 80° ± 15°
- Velocity-based cusp analysis: 72.8° ± 0.6°
- Curvature-based blind search: 79° (p = 1.24 × 10⁻¹⁴)
- Five independent methods converge: **75.4° ± 3.4°**
- Hook rate anti-correlates with wobble amplitude (r = −0.70)
- GRACE gravimetry confirms mass accumulation along same bearing
- Geomagnetic correlation: r = −0.98

### Paper 3: Coupling Quantification 
**"Critical Degradation of Earth's Rotational Coupling Revealed by Transfer Function Inversion and Broadband Polar Motion Analysis (1973–2026)"**

Establishes mechanism and current state:
- Broadband collapse: Chandler (98.6%), Annual (97.2%), Semiannual (93.7%)
- Coupling proxy η = 2.0% — at the boundary of complete failure
- Electromagnetic coupling identified as primary driver (r = 0.97 with dipole moment)
- Cascade mechanism: EM failure → topographic → gravitational
- Five independent observables converge:
  1. Dipole moment correlation
  2. Inner core rotation pause (2009)
  3. Free Core Nutation phase jump (2021–2022)
  4. Chandler phase instability
  5. Geomagnetic jerk-to-LOD lag reduction

## Coupling Trajectory

2010–2015:  η = 55%  ███████████████████████████████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░  Weakened

**Operational Thresholds:**
- Healthy: η ≥ 80%
- Weakened: 30–80%
- Critical: 10–30%
- Functional collapse: 2–10%
- Complete failure: η < 2%

## Physical Interpretation

The coupling mechanisms maintaining Earth's wobble oscillations are physically equivalent to those resisting gravitational reorientation forces from deep mantle density anomalies (LLSVPs). When forcing persists but response vanishes, the transfer function has failed.

**Implications:**
1. Gyroscopic stabilization has effectively ceased
2. Gravitational forcing from the African LLSVP increasingly dominates pole trajectory
3. The rotation pole exhibits systematic drift toward 75°W longitude
4. Resistance to true polar wander has been reduced by ~98%
